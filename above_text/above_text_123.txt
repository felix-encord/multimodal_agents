Metadata

<Note>Metadata is not supported for NIfTI.</Note>

<Note>Ensure your DICOM files and metadata follow the format outlined in the official DICOM specification.</Note>

The Encord DICOM metadata viewer renders DICOM files natively in the browser, allowing you to access all defined metadata fields and sequences associated with the DICOM file. 

The metadata viewer is displayed by toggling the _View metadata_ button above the series being annotated. The metadata viewer contains a search bar allowing you to search for specific types of metadata.
