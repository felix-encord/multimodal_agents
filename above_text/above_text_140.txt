Distance export

Encord supports copying measured distances using the polyline annotation type, separate from using the measurement tool as detailed above. 

1. Create a polyline annotation. 
2. Select the newly created polyline and click the three dots on the _Quick toolbar_ to copy the distance to your clipboard.
