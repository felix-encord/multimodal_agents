The 3D cylinder brush lets you apply a Bitmask in 3 dimensions, which means it is applied to multiple slices in a volume. The following two settings are available: 
- The _Size_ determines the diameter of the Bitmask brush.
- The _Height_ determines the thickness of the 3D Bitmask, measured in number of slices. 

Adjust the slider to set your desired _Size_ and _Height_. 

After the Bitmask is applied, click **Apply label** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to apply the Bitmask.

<Tip>
We recommend enabling 3D view in one of the windows of the Label Editor when using the 3D cylinder brush. This allows you to see the Bitmask label in 3D.

1. Select the Bitmask object and select the 3D cylinder brush.
2. Create your label in the main annotation window. 
3. Click _Additional controls_ and enable the _Full 3D_ toggle on a reconstructed view.
