**Skip tasks**

Users have the option to skip tasks in instances where, for example, the file is blurred, or if they suspect the task was erroneously added.

When a user skips a task, it is automatically unassigned from them, and the task's status is updated to _Skipped_. If another task is available, it automatically opens in the Label Editor and is assigned to the user.
