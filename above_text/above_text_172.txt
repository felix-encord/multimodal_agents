Labels pane

The _Labels_ pane shows all the instantiated objects and classifications for a data unit. Objects are grouped first by class, and sorted by creation time within each class, with earlier objects on top. They are named in an "ABC (0)" format, where ABC is the Ontology class and 0 is the first instance annotation.
