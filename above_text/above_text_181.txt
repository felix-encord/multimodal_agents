**Freehand edge touchup - Label Editor V1**

If you need to modify the edge of a polygon to account for complicated shapes or other requirements, the freehand edge touchup feature allows you edit the edge of the polygon in a free-hand manner, from one vertex to another.

<Tip>If you need to edit your shape along the edge of the polygon, _in between_ vertices, use the polygon brush tool instead.</Tip>

1. Click the polygon you would like to edit.
2. Click the _Freehand edge touchup_ icon in the floating toolbar that appears, or use the <kbd>F</kbd> hotkey to activate 'freehand edge touchup' mode.
3. Mouse over the vertex you would like to start editing from, and click to start the edit process.
4. Drag the cursor freely to draw out the new polygon edge. Navigate the cursor to the pre-existing vertex you want to finish on, and click to finalize the new edge boundary.
