Interpolation

Interpolation is run via the 'Automated labeling' drawer. Click the *Automated labeling* button to open the drawer. Select *Interpolation* from the drop-down menu, select the desired objects to interpolate, set the interpolation range (i.e., the range of frames) and click the *Run interpolation* button. Please note that you need a minimum two labels of an instance to run interpolation.
