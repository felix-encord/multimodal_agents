Primitives

Creating a primitive (f.k.a. skeleton templates) requires an ontology with a primitive annotation type. Use primitives to templatize shapes (e.g., 3D cuboids, pose estimation skeletons ) commonly used by your annotation team.

Instantiate a new primitive instance by clicking on the specified class in the 'Classes' menu or using the specified hotkey (e.g., <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>).

Instantiate existing primitive instances (i.e., primitives that should keep the same identifier in preceding or succeeding frames) by clicking on the _Highlight_ icon for the specified object or using the assigned hotkey (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>). See the bounding box documentation for visual instructions on how to instantiate existing primitives.

Primitives can be copy/pasted between frames using <kbd>cmd</kbd> (MacOS)/<kbd>ctrl</kbd> (Windows) + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy the object to the clipboard and <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste it at the location of the mouse cursor on the desired frame.

Primitives allow you to define properties of edges defined in your template as visible, occluded, or invisible. Toggle the edge property settings for a primitive by highlighting the primitive and clicking the *Show controls* button.
