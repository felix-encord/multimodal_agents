Dynamic attributes

Encord supports dynamic attributes for all object annotation types (i.e., bounding box, polygon, polyline, keypoint, and primitives).

Highlight the desired object to assign dynamic attributes. Dynamic attributes are recognized by the *Dynamic* tag next to the given feature in the ontology. Dynamic attributes are only applied in the frames specifically indicated but can be edited in ranges if they span multiple frames.
