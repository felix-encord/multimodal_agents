The following video goes through the basics of annotating images in the Label Editor.



Encord provides comprehensive support for image annotation. With the image editor, you can:

- Label using any annotation type such as bounding boxes, rotatable boxes, polygons, polylines, keypoints, and primitives.
- Create frame-level & object classifications.
- Object detection and instance segmentation.
- Reduce manual annotations with automation (e.g., importing model predictions) features.
