Polygon

Polygons are often necessary if you want to train your applications on the tightest object boundaries. Creating a  
polygon requires an Ontology with a polygon annotation type. Enable or disable free-hand drawing mode by pressing <kbd>d</kbd> on your keyboard. Polygon coarseness for polygons drawn free-hand is set in the 'Settings' drawer in the _Drawing settings_ drop-down. Instantiate a new polygon label by clicking on the specified class in the 'Classes' menu or using the specified hotkey (e.g., <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>).

A polygon can be closed by double-clicking anywhere on the canvas. Doing so will "snap" creating an edge between the last vertex to the first vertex drawn.

Polygon labels can be assigned static classifications should they be defined in your ontology:

- Highlight an object by clicking on it in the editor canvas or by clicking on the **+** icon or start/end frame in the range overview for the specified polygon
- Assign a classifications by clicking on the relevant buttons or using the set hotkeys (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>)
