Label Coordinates

In the JSON format, label coordinates are normalized to be between 0 and 1. This means that the corners of the frame or image correspond to the coordinates (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1) regardless of frame dimensions. 

To get the pixel values of normalized coordinates:

- The  and  coordinates of a label should be multiplied by the pixel width of the frame or image.
- The  and  coordinates of a label should be multiplied by the pixel height of the frame or image.
