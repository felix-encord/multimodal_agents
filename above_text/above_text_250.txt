Classifications

<Info> Classifications are supported for all modalities </Info>

Since classifications apply to the entire frame, there is no need for specific colors or shapes. _Classification annotation types_ include:

- **Checklist**: Allows multiple values. For example, "Weather" could be both cloudy and rainy.
- **Radio**: Allows a single value. For example, "Time of day" could be "Day" or "Night."
- **Text**: Allows freeform input for each situation.

<Note>Radio buttons can nest up to 7 layers deep. Check boxes and text fields do not support nesting.</Note>
