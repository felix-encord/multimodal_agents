_Transcript_ Attributes

_Transcript_ attributes are text fields specifically designed for transcribing audio files. Apply _Transcript_ attributes to _Audio Region_ objects and input the audio transcription directly into the text field. In the following example an _Audio Region_ object called "Beautiful Voice" has the _Transcription_ text attribute "Lyrics", which can be used to transcribe song lyrics.
