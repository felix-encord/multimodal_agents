Manual Quality Assurance

Manual quality assurance for annotation projects means that annotation tasks have to be reviewed before they can be marked as _Complete_.

You can set the following parameters for manual quality control in the _Settings_ tab in your annotation project shown in the screenshot below:

- The percentage of labels that are to be manually reviewed.
- Rules for distribution of review tasks.
- Common rejection reasons that can be used to identify and systematize errors in your labels.
- Reviewer to class and annotator mapping (e.g. label X with class Y should always be reviewed by reviewer Z).
- Assign tasks that are rejected after a specific number of review cycles for expert reviews.
