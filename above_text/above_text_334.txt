Add collaborators as a group

<Note>To add collaborators as a group, your organization needs to have user groups. Navigate to our documentation on creating user groups for more information.</Note>

Collaborators can be added to a project as a group - which can save time as well as ensure that no individual is forgotten.

In the 'Groups' section of the page, click on **Manage** to make the 'Manage Groups' pop-up appear.
