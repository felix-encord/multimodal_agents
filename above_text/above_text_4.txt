Classification models predict frame-level classifications in a project's Ontology. Rather than labeling objects within the data, classification models learn to characterize the frame as a whole. For example, a classification model trained to distinguish night from day can be used to determine whether a given image was taken during the day, or at night. 

<Note>Classification models assume there is only one correct class per image. </Note>
