Strict review

<Note>Strict review is enabled by default, but can be disabled under _Advanced settings_.</Note>

_Strict review_ ensures that crucial details are not overlooked during a review stage. Strict review aids in assuring higher accuracy when reviewing annotations. 

_Strict review_ stages do not auto-advance to the next review task after bulk approving or rejecting labels. Reviewers can make adjustments to their review, and add comments when rejecting tasks with missing annotations.
