Review and Refine Consensus Labels

Reviewers working in the Review and Refine block can see all labels from all annotators from a Consensus block. The reviewer is able to select the best labels from each object on a data unit and edit those labels or they can create new labels for the data unit.

The Review and Refine page is different for single images and all other data units. When reviewing and refining single images, expand each user to display their labels and decide on the best labels. When reviewing and refining videos, image groups, image sequences, and DICOM series, a timeline appears under the data unit. Use the timeline to speed up reviewing and refining all the labels on the data unit.
