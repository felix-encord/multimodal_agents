1. Onboard your annotators

You can add annotators during the creation phase, or by going to _Settings > Team_ and inviting new annotators. Remember that unlike in annotation Projects where each piece of data can only be seen by one annotator at a time, training Projects score each annotator against the same set of benchmark tasks. Therefore, a copy of each benchmark task will be added to the Project for each annotator added.
