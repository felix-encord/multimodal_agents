3. Evaluate annotator performance

Submitted tasks are automatically run through the benchmark function, and the annotators performance on the task is computed. Project administrators can confirm annotator progress and performance in the _Summary_ page. Use the _Overview_ tab for quick insights into overall annotator performance. Use the _Annotator submissions_ tab to confirm individual task submissions on a per-label basis.
