Creating labels for existing instances

You can use SAM to create labels for an existing object instance. 

1. Navigate to the frame you want to add the instance. 
2. Click **Instantiate object** next to the instance, or press the instance's hotkey on your keyboard (<kbd>W</kbd> in the example below).
