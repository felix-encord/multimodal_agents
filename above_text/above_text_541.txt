<Note>Objects are linked in the Label Editor during annotation, not during Ontology creation.</Note>

**Using _Relation_ attributes in the Label Editor**:

Once an Ontology with _Relation_ attributes has been set up, instances can be linked in the Label Editor during annotation. 

1. Create both instance labels. For example, a chicken and its wing are labeled using bounding boxes. 

2. Click the _Edit classifications_ button for the object with the _Relation_ attribute. For example, to the chicken wing.
