- Model Evaluation
    1. Train your model on exported annotations.
    2. Import model predictions into Encord Active.
    3. Use advanced analytics and quality metrics to:
        - Discover weak spots in your model.
        - Improve performance with actionable insights.
        - Leverage embedding plots to visualize model outputs and identify improvement areas.

<Tip>Use custom filtering to refine your data and label exploration, just as in Encord Index, to focus on areas that can enhance your model's performance.</Tip>
