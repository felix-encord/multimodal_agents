  <Accordion title=" How do I manage teams, or create user groups?">
    You can create user groups within your organization. These can be added to specific Projects as teams.

  - Our documentation on user groups can be found here.

  - For information on how to create teams for a given Project see the Team Management section in our documentation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does the 'This is being edited' pop-up in the label editor mean">
    Don't worry, no data has been lost! This is a warning from our system (known as the "editor lock") it occurs when:

- Two different people are editing a task at the same time.
- Or, that one individual has the task open in two different tabs, or browser windows.

In both cases we recommend to click 'cancel' to prevent any unexpected data overwrites.

See our documentation here for more details.

   <Accordion title=" Why is there a warning sign next to my Project where it's listed">

A warning symbol is displayed when a project is too large - meaning it contains too much data. When selecting the project you should encounter the following message:

> ⚠️ 
> "This project has exceeded the recommended number of tasks. To avoid performance issues, you need Admin access to manage and reduce the amount of data in this project".

The diagram below illustrates the steps you should take to fix the issue.
