Import HTML

HTML files can be imported locally, or from a private cloud server using a JSON file. 

When importing HTML pages, we recommend using the single-file extension format, which includes all elements necessary to render the page fully, such as CSS and JavaScript. This method ensures that all resources are bundled together, allowing the HTML page to display in the **Index** just as it would when hosted online.

<Info>
Importing as a single extension makes the page more visually appeasing in both Index and Annotate.

Here is a comparison of the same HTML page in Index, imported as a raw file and as a single extension.
