Prediction Branches

When importing prediction sets into Encord Active, they are added as branches to individual label rows on your data units (images, videos, audio). Each data unit has the following:
- A MAIN branch for ground truth annotations or pre-labels.
- Optional Consensus branches and Prediction branches for different prediction sets.
