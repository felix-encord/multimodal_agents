Encord Active provides the capability to visually explore data and label distributions using pre-defined and custom metrics.

Gaining insights into data distribution across diverse quality metrics allows for the identification of potential data gaps that could influence model performance on outliers or edge cases.

In a Project, access the _Analytics_ page to use the Metric Correlation chart and Class Distribution to explore your data, labels, and model predictions.

Data and label analytics display Metric Correlation and class distribution across your data and labels. You can adjust the X and Y values on the Metric Correlation across a number of data and label metrics. If the Project has no labels, the class distribution graph is empty.

Prediction analytics display Metric Correlation and prediction distribution for your ML model. Prediction distribution provides class and underrepresented class data. You can adjust the X and Y values on the Metric Correlation across a number of data and label metrics.
