Step 4: Import Project with Custom Embeddings

Before you can use your custom embeddings in Encord Active Projects, you need to import the custom embeddings. This is performed while you import your Annotate Project into Active.

For existing Active Projects, you can import custom embeddings for your Project import if your Project imported to **Data** or **Labels**. Importing to **Metrics & Embeddings** requires deleting the Project in Active and re-importing the Project with your custom embeddings.

<Note>After updating your embeddings, sync your Active Project to automatically apply the new embeddings.</Note>

**To import a Project with custom embeddings:**

1. Log in to the Encord platform.
   The landing page for the Encord platform appears.

2. Create a Project (Annotation Project or Training Project) in Encord Annotate.

3. Click **Active** from the main menu.
   The landing page for Active appears.
   
4. Click the **Import Annotate Project** button.
   The _Import an Annotate Project to Encord Active_ dialog appears.

5. Click the **Import** button for the Annotate Project you want to import.
   The _Confirm Project Import_ dialog appears.
