Label Duplicates

Ranks labels by how likely they are to represent the same object.

> Jaccard similarity coefficient is used to measure closeness of two annotations.

**Example 1:**

An annotator accidentally labels the same thing in a frame twice.

An annotator labeled the same orange twice in a frame. Look carefully at both images and you can see that there are two slightly different labels around the orange.
