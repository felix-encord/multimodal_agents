Add comments in Active

How comments are added, in Annotate and in Active, varies slightly:

- Comments in Annotate can be added to a task, to individual frames within a task, or to specific locations within a frame. 

- Comments in Active can be added to individual frames within a Project or to all frames within a Collection.
