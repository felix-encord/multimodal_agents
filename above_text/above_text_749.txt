Filters

In the Active Explorer for a Project you can refine searches by data quality metrics, label quality metrics, Collections, data types, annotation types, annotation classes, and by annotator from Annotate.

<Tip>
Filters provide the ability to include or exclude images based on your filtering criteria.

<b>Collections:</b> Collections are a new way to save interesting groups of data units and labels, to support and guide your downstream workflow.

<b>Custom Metadata:</b> Custom metadata added to Annotate Projects. When an Annotate Project imports to Active, if that Annotate Project has custom metadata, the custom metadata is available to filter your data in Active.

<Tip>
For information on importing custom metadata to an Annotate project, refer to Adding Metadata in the documentation.
