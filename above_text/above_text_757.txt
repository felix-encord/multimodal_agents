Custom Metadata in Active

Once your custom metadata is included in your Annotate Project (Folder or Dataset), you can create Collections based on your custom metadata and then send those Collections to Annotate.

1. Import your Project that has custom metadata.

2. Click the Project once import completes.  
   The Project opens with the Explorer page displaying.

3. Filter the Project _Data_, _Labels_, or _Predictions_ in the Explorer using a Custom Metadata filter.
