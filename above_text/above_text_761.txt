Active supports bulk changes made to the object label classes on data units in **Label Collections** to an Annotate Project.

<Note>Active Label Collections support editing object label classes of one object label type to the same label type. For example, bounding box to bounding box or bitmask to bitmask.</Note>

<Tip>Use the **Display** settings to help find labels that require action.</Tip>
