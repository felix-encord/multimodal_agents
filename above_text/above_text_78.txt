Creating keys using Terminal / Powershell

<Tip>
We strongly recommend using the Encord app to generate public-private key pairs.
</Tip>

Follow the steps below to generate a public-private key pair using an encryption library. Encryption libraries are part of most major operating systems, therefore you can generate this key pair using the appropriate terminal for your OS:

- **Linux/macOS**: the default terminal
- **Windows 10 & Server 2019/2022**: Powershell

To generate a public-private key pair:

1. Open Terminal or Powershell.

2. Run the following command:

   

3. Press enter to accept the default file location or modify as required:
   
   
   
   

4. \[**IMPORTANT**\] Leave the passphrase blank:

   

<Warning>
Ensure that the private key you have generated is not protected by a passphrase. Password-protected private keys cannot be authenticated in Encord. All private keys generated on the Encord platform are not password-protected by default.
</Warning>

You should now have two files:

-  contains your private key (which you should keep secure);
-  contains your public key (usually in a file ending in _.pub_).

The next step is to add your public key to Encord. To add your public key to Encord:

1. Copy the contents of the public key file. For that, execute:

   

2. Navigate to the 'Public keys' section of the _Settings_ to create, register and manage your public keys.
