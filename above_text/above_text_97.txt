<Note>The _Single label review_ feature can also be considered "turbo review mode," analogous to the "turbo attribute mode" in annotation mode, because it allows the reviewer to quickly step through and review instance attributes. "Turbo attribute mode" in the editor settings can be disabled while in review mode.</Note>
