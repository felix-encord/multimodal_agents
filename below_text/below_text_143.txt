Bounding box instances can be assigned with static and dynamic attributes should they be defined in your Ontology.

- Highlight an object by clicking on it in the DICOM editor canvas or by clicking on the _Plus_ icon or start/end slice in the range overview for the specified bounding box.

- Assign classifications by clicking on the relevant buttons or using the set hotkeys (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>).
