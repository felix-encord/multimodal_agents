Panoptic settings allow you to determine how different bitmasks interact with one another. 

- **None**: Overlapping bitmasks are allowed. The bitmask will overlap with existing bitmasks.
- **Exclude**: Areas already covered by a bitmask will be excluded from the bitmask.
- **Overwrite**: Areas already covered by a bitmask will be overwritten by the new bitmask.
