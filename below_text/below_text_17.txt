The settings have several tabs:

- **General**: Your user login credentials. Change your password and set up Multi-Factor Authentication for your Encord user account. This is where Encord Labs appears, if available.
- **Public keys**: creating and managing SDK & API keys.
- **Notifications**: creating and managing push notifications.
