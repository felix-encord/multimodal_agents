Instantiate existing polygon instances (i.e., polygons that should keep the same identifier in preceding or succeeding frames) by clicking on the _Highlight_ icon for the specified object or using the assigned hotkey (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>). See the bounding box documentation for visual instructions on how to instantiate existing polygons.

Polygons can be copy/pasted between frames using <kbd>cmd</kbd> (MacOS)/<kbd>ctrl</kbd> (Windows) + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy the object to the clipboard and <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste it at the location of the mouse cursor on the desired frame.

Polygon instances can be assigned with static and dynamic attributes should they be defined in your Ontology:

- Highlight an object by clicking on it in the editor canvas or by clicking on the _Plus_ icon or start/end frame in the range overview for the specified polygon.

- Assign classifications by clicking on the relevant buttons or using the set hotkeys (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>,
  <kbd>u</kbd>).

See the bounding box documentation for visual instructions on how to assign classifications.
