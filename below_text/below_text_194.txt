Instantiate existing polyline instances (i.e., polylines that should keep the same identifier in preceding or succeeding frames) by clicking on the _Highlight_ icon for the specified object or using the assigned hotkey (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>). See the documentation for visual instructions on how to instantiate existing polylines.

Polyline instances can be assigned with static and dynamic attributes should they be defined in your Ontology:

- Highlight an object by clicking on it in the editor canvas or by clicking on the _Plus_ icon or start/end frame in the range overview for the specified polyline.

- Assign a classification by clicking on the relevant buttons or using the set hotkeys (e.g., <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>).
