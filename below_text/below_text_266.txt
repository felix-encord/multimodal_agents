- **A**. 'Add a primitive': Start creating a new object primitive template.
- **B**. 'Names hidden': Show or hide the vertex names in the canvas.
- **C**. 'Add a point': Add more points on the canvas. Points are added to the list of points as they are made.
- **D**. 'Add an edge': Add more edges. Mouseover the first point and click once before clicking over the  
  end point of the edge. Edges are added to the list of edges as they are created.
- **E**. 'Move/edit': Move vertices. Mouseover the vertex you wish to move. Click and drag to move the target vertex to the new desired location.
- **F**. 'Save current state': Save the template. If you exit the editor screen without saving all your work will be lost.
- **G**. 'Name': Enter a name for this object primitive. This name will be displayed in the ontology structure _object annotation type_ selection.
- **H**. 'Delete template': Delete this object primitive. Please ensure you've removed this object primitives from  
  all connected _objects_ before deleting, or the ontology structure may enter an unstable state.
- **I**. 'Points': List of points with their coordinates and names. Coordinates are defined as (0, 0) in the  
  upper left. You can also add points using the **+ Add a point** button at the bottom of the list.
- **J**. 'Edges': List of edges. You can also add edges by using the **+ Add an edge** button at the bottom of the list.

**To create an object primitive**:

1. Click **Add a primitive** (A). 
2. Give your primitive a meaningful name. 
3. Click **Add**. You are now ready to set up your primitive.
2. Click _Add a point_ (C). Add as many points as you need. 
3. Click _Add an edge_ (D). Connect your points as needed. 
4. Click _Save current state_ (F) to save your primitive.

<Tip>You can adjust the color of points and edges by clicking the color circle next to their names in the list of points and edges.</Tip>

**To use your object primitive:**

1. Return to the _Schema_ tab of your Ontology. 
2. Click **+ Add object**.
3. Select your object primitive from the list of Object classes.
4. Save your Ontology.
