Turning on the  feature preloads the next task in the background while the user is working in the Label Editor. This reduces wait times for the next task after submitting a task. This setting is disabled by default.

When enabled, the preloaded task is automatically assigned to the user, preventing others from initiating it.  

<Info>
- This feature is only supported for single images.
- Only the image is preloaded. Labels are not preloaded.
