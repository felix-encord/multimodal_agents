You can assign the following roles to collaborators:

- **Annotator**: annotators are responsible for labeling. This is the default role for all collaborators.
- **Reviewer**: for reviewing labeled tasks.
- **Annotator & reviewer**: a combination of annotator and reviewer.
- **Team manager**: a team manager can assign tasks to other users, and add collaborators to the project.
- **Admin**: gives this collaborator full administrative control over this Project. This is an irreversible action.
