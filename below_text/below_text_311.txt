The **Reopen** button allows Administrators and Team Managers to send tasks which are currently Completed or In review back to annotation. Select your target tasks using the checkboxes in the File column to select individual assets, or select the checkbox in the column header to select all tasks, and press the **Reopen** button to move all selected tasks back to the annotation stage. Tasks reopened in this way will have the status _Returned_ in the _Queue_ tab. No labels are lost by reopening a task. The 'Reopen' action is only applied to tasks which are both visible (i.e. not filtered out by the file search) and selected.
