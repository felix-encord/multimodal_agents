The **Reopen** button allows Administrators and Team Managers to send tasks which are currently _Completed_ back to the annotation stage. Select your target tasks using the checkboxes in the _File_ column to select individual assets, or select the checkbox in the column header to select all tasks, and press the **Reopen** button to move all selected tasks back to the annotation stage. Tasks reopened in this way will have the status _Returned_ in the _Queue_ tab. No labels are lost by reopening a task. The 'Reopen' action is only applied to tasks which are both visible (i.e. not filtered out by the file search) and selected.
