Learn how to add collaborators to different stages of a Project by visiting the relevant sections in this document:

- **Annotate** collaborators.
- **Review** collaborators. 
- Collaborator type **Router**.

If no collaborators are specified at a given stage, all users with permissions are added by default.

- Annotator
- Annotator & Reviewer
- Team Manager
- Admin
