Admins and Team Managers can change the status of a Project to any of the following:

- Not started
- In progress
- Paused
- Completed
- Cancelled

<Info>Updating the Project status changes the Project icon accordingly.</Info>

When the Project status is changed to either _Paused_, _Completed_, or _Cancelled_ then Annotators, Reviewers, and Annotator + Reviewers are prevented from opening tasks, and the **Initiate** button is greyed out. Admins and Team Managers are able to annotate and review tasks as usual, regardless of the Project status. 

<Note> 
Tasks can still be opened using back door access. For example if an Admin shares a specific URL of a task with an Annotator, Reviewer, or Annotator + Reviewer.
