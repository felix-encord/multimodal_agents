**Instance statistics**

This section provides the total count of all instances across the datasets in your project.

- **Project total**: Shows total instances (both objects and classifications) across the project by default. To get instance statistics for individual data files, click the drop-down to select a data file.
- **Select class**: Shows the total instances for a particular class. This is a summary of how a given class is distributed across your project's data assets. The pie chart segments show a breakdown of how that class is split across the data assets.
- **Display timestamps**: Flip the toggle to switch between frame numbers and timestamps for the labels.

**Label statistics**

This is a summary of how your labels are distributed across the project. The pie chart shows a breakdown of how many labels there are for a given class.

- **Project total**: Shows the total number of labels across different datasets in the project. To get label stats for individual data files, click the drop-down to select a data file.
- **Objects**: Click on the pie chart segment of a class to see the total number of labels and its attributes (sometimes called nested attributes) if available for that class.
- **Classifications**: Shows the global classification at project or individual video level. For example, location, time of day, etc.
