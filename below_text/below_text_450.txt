Instance identifiers are unique within a project and can be found in several ways:  

- **In the Label Editor:** Click on an instance, then select **Copy identifier** from the instance action menu.  
- **In Exported Labels:** Look for  or  in the exported data.  
- **Using the SDK:** Specify your own  or  during label uploads.  

Once you have an identifier, use the **Search instance** interface to filter and locate the specific instance. This is especially useful for visually confirming annotations linked to an identifier.  

After finding your instance, click **View** in the **Actions** column to jump directly to the first annotation of that instance in the dataset.
