1. Apply object labels to **all** relevant frames.

2. Add the dynamic attribute to the label in the first frame that the object appears in.

3. Navigate to the point of the video or image sequence where the dynamic attribute changes value, and apply the attribute to the object here. 

4. Use the **+****, or the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to set _keyframes_ on frames where the attribute changes value. 

5. Use the _Play_ icon, or the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to apply attribute values to all frames following a _keyframe_, matching the value set in the _keyframe_.

**Apply to new occurrences**:

The _Apply to new occurrences_ checkbox in the Label Editor is available for the first instance of a label with a dynamic attribute. Selecting this option propagates the attribute to all future instance labels, meaning all labels created for this instance share the attribute value of the initial instance label.
