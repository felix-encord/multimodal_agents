  <Step title="Use Custom Analytic Dashboards">
    You can create custom analytic dashboards using Distribution and Correlation charts. For more information on analytics dashboards, refer to our documentation.

<Tip>Adding custom metadata to your data can significantly improve the insights you can gather from your data. We recommend importing customer metadata with your data, but you can import custom metadata after importing your data.</Tip>
