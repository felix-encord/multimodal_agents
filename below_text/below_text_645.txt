If the upload is unsuccessful, ensure that:
- Your provider permissions are set correctly 
- The object data format is supported
- The upload JSON or CSV file is correctly formatted. 

<Tip>
Check which files failed to upload by clicking the _Export_ icon to download a CSV log file. Every row in the CSV corresponds to a file which failed to be uploaded.

<Note>You only see failed uploads if the **Ignore individual file errors** toggle was not enabled during cloud data registration.</Note>
