- Select the model you would like to run. You will be able to choose from a list of models previously attached to the project. 

- The 'Detection range' lets you determine the start and end frames you would like the model to run on. 

- Set the _Confidence_. A value ranging from 0 to 1 that represents how confident the model has to be in order for a particular data point to be included in its output. Read more about confidence values here.

- Set the _Polygon coarseness_. The coarseness controls the spacing between two vertices. A low polygon coarseness allows for high resolution polygons, but creates high vertex counts. To avoid possible performance issues with large or complicated polygons, set the coarseness only as fine as necessary to accurately define the desired segmentation.
