Similar to duplicates, near-duplicate images are images where one image slightly differs from another due to shifts, blurriness, or distortion. Consequently, they should also be eliminated from the dataset. However, in this scenario, a decision is required to determine which sample remains and which is discarded. These images possess scores marginally greater than 0 and are displayed alongside one another in the Explorer grid view workspace, facilitating easy comparison.
