At some point in the video, the labels on the cars are swapped OR a new label gets applied to one or both of the cars. \\n\\nFor example, for two neighboring frames, say $ and , we assume that for every object  in frame , the object  in frame  with the highest IOU to  should have the same \\n\\nFor every object in frame , the algorithm works by computing the IOU between that object and every object in frame  to select the one with the highest IOU. If those two objects have the same objectHash, all good, score will be zero. There’s nothing to flag. If, on the other hand, the two objects do not share the same objectHash, it’s flagged by setting the score to the IOU between the two. \\n\\nThink of  as the best match (highest IOU) in the following frame.', 'In the above, we use  as a shorthand for objectHash.\\n\\nIn turn, \\n\\n- A score equal to 0 means that no issues were found.\\n- A score close to zero (but not zero) means that there is inconsistency in the object hashes but the objects do not overlap much, so it is less likely to be an actual label error.\\n- A score closer to one means that the two objects have a high overlap and inconsistency in object hash.\\n\\n**Example**\\n\\nIn this example, one track is inconsistent. The green guy has had objectHash  for a while, and suddenly it changes to .

However, in that situation, the IOU falls back to the identity function']\n",

      "Encord is a comprehensive data engine and software stack solution offering a range of features to streamline and optimize your ML workflow. It consists of three main components: Annotate, Active, and Index.\n",
      "**Index:** Index provides Encord's storage for your images, image groups, image sequences, videos, and DICOM. Once your local data imports into, or cloud data registers with, Encord you can create Datasets for your Projects based on your data. Your data can belong to multiple Datasets and Projects. Learn more about Index here.\n",

      "**Annotate:** Annotate is a powerful tool that enables users to create labeling workflows and transform unlabeled data into labeled data. Label data with object boundaries and classification labels, and review labels using manual or automatic quality assurance methods. Annotate simplifies the process of creating high-quality labeled datasets, which are essential for training ML models. Learn more about Annotate here.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Active:** Active facilitates the validation and debugging of datasets through systematic active-learning cycles. Analyze your annotated data sets to hone in on the best labels, while rejecting those hindering a model's performance. By iteratively refining your training data, Active helps improve the quality and performance of ML models over time. Learn more about Active here.\n",
