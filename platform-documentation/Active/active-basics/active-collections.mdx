## What are Collections?

Collections provide a way to save interesting groups of data units and labels, to support and guide your downstream workflow. By grouping your data into Collections you are able to:

- Save data units or labels, individually or in bulk, into new or existing collections.

- Curate higher-quality data collections for annotation, creating and grouping a range of different data units or labels into collections for better overview, data management, and structure.

- Create, edit, view, manage, and act on collections within one tab.
