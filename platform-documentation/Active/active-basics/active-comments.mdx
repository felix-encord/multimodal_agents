Comments provide a way to communicate with Annotators, Reviewers, Annotators & Reviewers, Team Managers, and Admins within Annotation projects and Active projects.

Comments are supported across Annotate and Active, meaning comments made in Annotate can be seen in Active and comments made in Active can be seen in Annotate.

## Add comments in Active

How comments are added, in Annotate and in Active, varies slightly:

- Comments in Annotate can be added to a task, to individual frames within a task, or to specific locations within a frame. 

- Comments in Active can be added to individual frames within a Project or to all frames within a Collection.
