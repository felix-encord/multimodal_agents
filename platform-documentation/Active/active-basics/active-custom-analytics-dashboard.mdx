You can create custom analytics dashboards from the _Analytics View_ using _Distribution_ and _Correlation_ charts.

## Distribution charts

Distribution charts display distributions and summaries of the selected metrics and custom metadata.

Here are some examples:

- Data unit: Height, Width, Frame number
- Label: Label duplicates, Broken track, Inconsistent track, Inconsistent class
- Categorical: Workflow stages, Custom Metadata (enum with their enum options, numeric, date time, and boolean), Classes, Annotator, Attribute

<Note>`varchar` (previously `string`), `text` (previously `long_string`), and `uuid` are NOT SUPPORTED for use in Distribution charts.</Note>

## Correlation charts

Correlation charts display a scatter plot of two attributes to show correlation within your current filtered view. Correlation charts require numeric data.

<Note>While Distribution charts support a number of custom metadata types, Correlation charts ONLY SUPPORT `numeric` custom metadata.</Note>
