Overview shortcuts for Data, Labels, and Predictions and Prediction Types for Predictions, give you a quick method to filter your unwanted or problematic images. They are shortcuts to improving datasets and model performance. They give you a quick launch pad to improve your data and your model performance.

<Note>The overview shortcuts for Data, Labels, and Predictions in the _Overview_ tab are generalized. Contact us if you want personalized shortcuts populating the _Overview_ tab.</Note>

## Use Issue and Prediction Type shortcuts

This process assumes that there is already one or more Projects in Active.

**To use Issue and Prediction Type shortcuts:**

1. Log in to the Encord platform.
   The landing page for the Encord platform appears.
   
2. Click **Active** in the main menu.
   The landing page for Active appears.

3. Click the Project.
   The landing page for the Project appears with the _Explorer_ tab selected.

4. Click **Data**, **Labels**, or **Predictions**.
   The Explorer workspace changes based on what you clicked. The Overview tab displays with the shortcuts.

5. Click a shortcut.
   A filter is applied to the images. The images appearing in the Explorer workspace changes depending on which shortcut you click.

6. Click **Filter** if you want to modify the filter settings.

7. Further search, sort, and filter the data.

8. Create a Collection based on the results.

9. Create a Dataset (and Project) and send that Dataset to Annotate.

10. Further annotate your data.

11. Rinse and repeat until you have the dataset you need for optimal model performance.
