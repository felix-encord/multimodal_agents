## Custom Metadata in Active

Once your custom metadata is included your files or label rows, you can create Collections based on your custom metadata and then send those Collections to Annotate.

1. [Import your Project that has custom metadata](/platform-documentation/Active/active-import/active-import-from-annotate).

2. Open the Project in Active once import completes.  
   The Project opens with the Explorer page displaying.

3. Filter the Project _Data_, _Labels_, or _Predictions_ in the Explorer using a Custom Metadata filter.

4. Continue searching, sorting, and filtering your data/labels/predictions until you have the subset of the data you need.

5. Select one or more of the images in the Explorer workspace.  
   A ribbon appears at the bottom of the Explorer workspace.

6. Click **Select all** to select all the images.

7. Click **Add to a Collection**.

8. Click **New Collection**.
