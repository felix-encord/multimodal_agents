## TLDR;

Do you already know what you are doing and only want to look over a Jupyter Notebook example? We provide one [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c6oqFV7l3CSW_83DgbNXIXAnRmDyIlB_?usp=sharing).

## Active's Default Embeddings

Currently in Active, we calculate and display embeddings using a generic CLIP model. This model is excellent for a wide range of tasks and across the board performance. However, a generic CLIP model may struggle with highly specialized tasks. The embeddings generated from the generic model are used for: Natural Language Search (not supported for custom embeddings), image similarity search and the embeddings view (where you view *reduced* embeddings).

## Custom Embeddings Support

We currently support embeddings of dimensions ranging from 1 to 4096 for Index, and 1 to 2000 for Active, following on from our in-house clip Embeddings. 

We support embeddings for images, image sequences and image groups. Support for Videos is coming soon.

## Use Custom Embeddings in Active

To use custom embeddings in Active:

1. Add an Embedding type to your custom metadata schema.
2. Upload your embeddings as custom metadata.
3. Create an Annotate Project.
4. Select your custom embeddings as you import the Project to Active.

### Step 1: Create an Embedding Field

import CustomEmbeddingStep1 from '/snippets/Index/Metadata/CustomEmbeddingStep1.mdx';


<CustomEmbeddingStep1 />

### Step 2: Upload Embeddings

import CustomEmbeddingStep2 from '/snippets/Index/Metadata/CustomEmbeddingStep2.mdx';

<CustomEmbeddingStep2 />

### Step 3 : Create a Project in Annotate

The following task outlines the basics of creating an Annotate Project. For detailed instructions, [refer to the documentation here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-create-projects).

**To create an Annotate Project:**

1. Go to **Annotate > Projects**. 
   The Annotate Projects list appears. 

2. Click **New annotation project**.
   The _Create New Project_ page appears.

3. Provide a meaningful title and description.

4. Select an Ontology.

5. Select one or more Datasets.

6. Load a Workflow template.

7. Add collaborators to the Project.

8. Click **Create Project**.

### Step 4: Import Project with Custom Embeddings

Before you can use your custom embeddings in Encord Active Projects, you need to import the custom embeddings. This is performed while you import your Annotate Project into Active.

For existing Active Projects, you can import custom embeddings for your Project import if your Project imported to **Data** or **Labels**. Importing to **Metrics & Embeddings** requires deleting the Project in Active and re-importing the Project with your custom embeddings.

<Note>After updating your embeddings, sync your Active Project to automatically apply the new embeddings.</Note>

**To import a Project with custom embeddings:**

1. Log in to the Encord platform.
   The landing page for the Encord platform appears.

2. Create a Project ([Annotation Project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manage-annotation-projects) or [Training Project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-training-projects)) in Encord Annotate.

3. Click **Active** from the main menu.
   The landing page for Active appears.
   
4. Click the **Import Annotate Project** button.
   The _Import an Annotate Project to Encord Active_ dialog appears.

5. Click the **Import** button for the Annotate Project you want to import.
   The _Confirm Project Import_ dialog appears.

   ![Import custom embeddings](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/active/workflows/active-custom-embedding-import.png).

6. Select the custom embeddings you want to import to the Project, under _Metrics & Embeddings_.

7. Select **Import** under _Metrics & Embeddings_.

8. Click **Proceed**.
   The Annotate Project imports with your custom embeddings.

## End-to-End Custom Embeddings Example

We provide an end-to-end example using a [Jupyter Notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c6oqFV7l3CSW_83DgbNXIXAnRmDyIlB_?usp=sharing).
