Encord Active provides the capability to visually explore data and label distributions using pre-defined and custom metrics.

Gaining insights into data distribution across diverse quality metrics allows for the identification of potential data gaps that could influence model performance on outliers or edge cases.

In a Project, access the _Analytics_ page to use the Metric Correlation chart and Class Distribution to explore your data, labels, and model predictions.

Data and label analytics display Metric Correlation and class distribution across your data and labels. You can adjust the X and Y values on the Metric Correlation across a number of data and label metrics. If the Project has no labels, the class distribution graph is empty.

Prediction analytics display Metric Correlation and prediction distribution for your ML model. Prediction distribution provides class and underrepresented class data. You can adjust the X and Y values on the Metric Correlation across a number of data and label metrics.

## Outliers

In the Outliers section, Active provides a quick summary of data or label outliers that you might want to investigate.

## 2D metrics


In the _2D Metrics View_, the first metric values are plotted on the x-axis, while the values of the second metric are represented on the y-axis. This visualization allows for an examination of the relationship between these two metrics and their potential interactions within the data and labels.

## Interactive exploration

Access the Explorer page and select a quality metric (such as `Brightness` or `Object Annotation Quality`) from the _Order by_ drop-down. This menu is located above the natural language search bar and enables data to be organized according to the chosen criteria.

The dashboard displays data distribution based on the selected metric. Navigating through the ordered dataset is possible by progressing through visualized data items. It is also feasible to perform range selections on the distribution chart or apply the chosen metric as a filter and utilize the slider to define a specific range.
