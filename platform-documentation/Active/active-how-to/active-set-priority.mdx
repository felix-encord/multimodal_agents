After creating a Collection, you can adjust the task priorities of images/frames in the Collection when the Collection is sent to Annotate. That means regardless of the image's/frame's current status in the Workflow (Annotate, Review, Complete) the priority is applied to the images/frames in Annotate.

### Important Information

- Priorities can only be specified on Annotate Projects that use Workflows. Priorities cannot be specified for Manual QA or Automated QA Annotate Projects.

- There is no insight on the image's/frame's current priority in Annotate

- There is no insight on the image's/frame's current status in the Workflow (Annotate, Review, Complete) in Annotate

- Reopening a closed task, maintains the priority specified from the Collection

## Send Priorities to Annotate

In addition to priorities, all comments, on individual frames/images and the comment added for the Collection, are sent to the Annotate Project.
