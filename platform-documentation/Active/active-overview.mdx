Active is tightly integrated with Encord Annotate, with Active and Annotate being hosted by Encord.

[Encord Active](https://encord.com/encord-active/) is active learning solutions that help you find failure modes in your models, and improve your data quality and model performance.

Use Active to visualize your data, evaluate your models, surface model failure modes, find labeling mistakes, prioritize high-value data for relabeling and more!

## What data does Encord Active support?

<Info>
Active supports analysis (Advanced Metrics and Embeddings) on images and videos up to 4K resolution. Performance is affected for images and videos over 4K.

For optimal performance, we strongly recommend downscaling images and videos over 4K to 4K resolution.

Filtering:

- Objects + all attributes
- Classification + all attributes

Model evaluation:

- Objects and Classifications cannot be mixed
- Classification support includes top level radio button
- Object support includes top level object
