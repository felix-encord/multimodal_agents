API keys provide a secure way to authenticate with Encord without needing a user login or password. They are used for [authentication](/sdk-documentation/general-sdk/authentication-sdk) when working with the Encord SDK or API. After registering your public key, you can programmatically create, manage, and query Projects, Datasets, and labels through the SDK or API.

<Note>  
Encord uses public/private key pairs for API keys. You register a public key with Encord and securely store the private key. The private key is then used for authentication. Learn more about public-key cryptography [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).  
</Note>

## Generating keys in Encord (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the _Public keys_ section of the [_Settings_](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-settings-general) to create, register and manage your public keys.

<div class="flex justify-center">
   <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/public-key-screen.png" />
</div>

2. Click the **New Key** button to add or generate a new key.

<div class="flex justify-center">
   <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/add-key-button.png" />
</div>

3. Give the public key a meaningful name. 

4. Click **Generate key pair** to generate a new public/private key pair. 
The public key field is automatically populated, and a `.txt` containing your corresponding private key is downloaded. 

<Warning>
You must click **Create** to create your API key. The **Create** button becomes available once both fields are populated.
</Warning>

</div>

5. Click **Create** to add your public key to Encord.
The key is now listed in the _Public keys_ section along with an ID that serves as a unique identifier.

<Info>
Key names do not have to be unique, but the keys themselves do. Attempting to upload a duplicate key results in an error.

## Creating keys using Terminal / Powershell

<Tip>
We strongly recommend using the Encord app to [generate public-private key pairs](#generating-keys-in-encord-recommended).
</Tip>

Follow the steps below to generate a public-private key pair using an encryption library. Encryption libraries are part of most major operating systems, therefore you can generate this key pair using the appropriate terminal for your OS:

- **Linux/macOS**: the default terminal
- **Windows 10 & Server 2019/2022**: Powershell

To generate a public-private key pair:

1. Open Terminal or Powershell.

2. Run the following command:

   ```
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
   ```

3. Press enter to accept the default file location or modify as required:
   
   ```bash Mac
   > Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Modify / Press ENTER]
   ```
   ```bash Windows
   > Enter a file in which to save the key (C:\Users\YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Modify / Press ENTER]
   ```
   ```bash Linux
   > Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Modify / Press ENTER]
   ```

4. \[**IMPORTANT**\] Leave the passphrase blank:

   ```
   > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press ENTER]
   > Enter same passphrase again: [Press ENTER]
   ```

<Warning>
Ensure that the private key you have generated is not protected by a passphrase. Password-protected private keys cannot be [authenticated in Encord](#authenticate-with-your-private-key). All private keys [generated on the Encord platform](#generating-keys-in-encord-recommended) are not password-protected by default.
</Warning>

You should now have two files:

- `/path/to/your/key/id_ALGORITHM` contains your private key (which you should keep secure);
- `/path/to/your/key/id_ALGORITHM.pub` contains your public key (usually in a file ending in _.pub_).

The next step is to add your public key to Encord. To add your public key to Encord:

1. Copy the contents of the public key file. For that, execute:

   ```
   $ cat /path/to/your/key/id_ALGORITHM.pub
     # Then select and copy the contents of the id_ALGORITHM.pub file
     # displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
   ```

2. Navigate to the 'Public keys' section of the [_Settings_](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-settings-general) to create, register and manage your public keys.

<div class="flex justify-center">
   <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/public-key-screen.png" />
</div>

3. Enter a title for your public key in the first field, and paste your public key in the second field. The **Create** button will become available once both fields have been populated.

4. Click **Create** to add your public key to Encord. It will now be listed showing the key's name, as well as a signature that serves as a unique identifier.

## Authenticate with your private key

After registering your public key with Encord, use your private key as credentials to authenticate the SDK or API. For detailed instructions, refer to the [SDK](/sdk-documentation/general-sdk/authentication-sdk) or [API](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-api-overview) documentation.
