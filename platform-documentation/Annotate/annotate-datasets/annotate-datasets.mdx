<Note>Data added prior to the release of _Index_ is stored in Mirrored Datasets. Learn more about Mirrored Datasets [here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#mirrored-datasets).</Note>

Datasets are subsets of your files that can be attached to one or more Projects for annotation. Datasets are created from files you upload to Encord.

## Creating Datasets

1. Click the **New dataset** button in the _Datasets_ section in _Annotate_.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/annotate-new-dataset.png" width="700" />
</div>

2. Give your Dataset a meaningful title and description. A clear title and description keeps your data organized.

<Tip>Toggle **Looking to create a mirrored dataset?** to create a [Mirrored Dataset](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#mirrored-datasets). </Tip>

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/create-dataset.png" width="500" />
</div>

3. Click **Create dataset** to create the Dataset. 

## Attach Data

After a Dataset has been created, you can attach data.

<Tip>[You can add data to Datasets from the _Files_ or the _Datasets_ screens](/platform-documentation/Index/index-files#add-data-to-datasets).</Tip>

<Tip>
To ensure smoother uploads and faster completion times, and avoid hitting absolute file limits, we recommend adding smaller batches of data. Limit uploads to 100 videos or up to 1,000 images at a time. You can also create multiple Datasets, all of which can be linked to a single Project. Familiarize yourself with our [limits and best practices for data import and registration](/platform-documentation/General/best-practices#import-into-encord) before adding data to Encord. 
</Tip>

1. Navigate to the _Datasets_ section under the _Annotate_ heading.
2. Click the Dataset you want to add data to. 
3. Click **+Attach existing files**. 

<Tip>If the files you want have not been uploaded into Encord yet, click **+Upload files** to [add new files](/platform-documentation/Index/index-files#upload-files-to-a-folder).</Tip>

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/attach-existing-files.png" width="600" />
</div>

4. Select the folders containing the files you want to attach to the Dataset. To select individual files, double-click a folder to see its contents, and select the files you want to add to the Dataset. 

5. Click **Attach data** to attach the selected files to the Dataset.

## Register Cloud Data to Datasets

<Tip>We recommend registering files in batches not exceeding 2GB, to ensure upload does not exceed 3 hours.</Tip>

1. [Create a Dataset](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#creating-datasets). 

2. Select the Dataset you want to add data to. 

3. Click **+Upload files**.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/upload-files-dataset.png" width="600" />
</div>

4. Select a folder to store the files in, or create a new folder.

5. Select the _Import from private cloud_ tab and select the integration you want to use. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/import-from-private-cloud.png" width="400" />
</div>

6. Click **Add JSON or CSV files** to upload a [JSON](#json-format) or [CSV](#csv-format) file specifying the cloud data that is to be added to the Dataset. Turn on the **Ignore individual file errors** toggle to ignore errors caused by files not supported by Encord.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/upload-json-or-csv.png" width="400" />
</div>

<Tip>We recommend enabling the **Ignore individual file errors** toggle. This ensures that the entire upload does not fail if only one file cannot be added.</Tip>

7. Click **Import** to add your cloud data to the Dataset. 

<Note>The data is be fetched from your cloud storage and processed asynchronously. This involves fetching appropriate metadata and other file information to help us render the files appropriately and to check for any framerate inconsistencies. We do not store your files in any way.</Note>

## Mirrored Datasets

Mirrored Datasets provide a continuity solution that retains the organization of data prior to the release of _Index_. With the transition to Index, all existing data within Datasets has been transferred to _Files_ in the form of Mirrored Datasets. Mirrored Datasets can be managed using both the Files and Datasets sections of the Encord platform.

For example, moving a file named "chicken.mp4" from a mirrored Dataset titled "Animal videos" to another mirrored Dataset called "Chicken videos", results in "chicken.mp4" being visible in all Projects associated with "Chicken videos".

## Entity Relationships

The following diagram illustrates how Datasets relate to other entities in Encord.

The following diagram shows how entities in Encord are organized. 

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Project {
        string project_hash
    }
    DataUnit {
        string data_hash
        string data_title
        string client_metadata
    }
    Dataset {
        string dataset_hash
        string dataset_title
    }
    Ontology {
        string ontology_hash
        string ontology_name
        string ontology_description
    }
    Workflow {
        string workflow_hash
    }
    Collaborator {
        string user
    }

    Project ||--o| Dataset : "attaches"
    Project ||--o| Ontology : "attaches"
    Project ||--o| Workflow : "follows"
    Project ||--o{ Collaborator : "includes"
    Dataset ||--o{ DataUnit : "composed of"
```

- Projects bring together Ontologies, Datasets, Workflows, and collaborators.
- A Project can have multiple Datasets attached to it, but only one Ontology.
- One Ontology can be attached to multiple Projects.

## Roles and Permissions

Collaborator permissions can be set in the [_Team_ section of the Dataset _Settings_](#team).

<div class="flex justify-center">

| Permission      | Admin | Viewer |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| View dataset    | ✅     | ✅      |
| Add data        | ✅     | ❌      |
