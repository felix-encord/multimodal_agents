<Warning>
If using Windows, we recommend using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip the exported labels.
</Warning>

## Label Coordinates

In the JSON format, label coordinates are normalized to be between 0 and 1. This means that the corners of the frame or image correspond to the coordinates (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1) regardless of frame dimensions. 

To get the pixel values of normalized coordinates:

- The `x` and `h` coordinates of a label should be multiplied by the pixel width of the frame or image.
- The `y` and `w` coordinates of a label should be multiplied by the pixel height of the frame or image.

</div>

## Format of Exported Labels

<Warning>
The `last_edited_by` and `last_edited_at` fields are updated only when the label or its nested attributes are modified in the Label Editor. If the SDK is used to update the label, these fields must be updated manually.
</Warning>

The tables below provide descriptions of all values contained JSON format exports.

<Note>Exports of label versions for which the data unit was deleted vary from the examples shown below - the `data_type` is `deleted`, while image groups and image sequences only contain a single `data_unit`.</Note>

### Single Images

The export contains a list of JSON objects, with each JSON object representing a single data unit and containing detailed information for all exported labels.

The example below describes all the keys for a single exported data unit.

### Image Groups & Image Sequences

<Tip>Confused about the difference between image groups and image sequences? See our [documentation here](/platform-documentation/General/general-supported-data#comparing-file-formats) to learn about different data types in Encord.</Tip>

The export contains a list of JSON objects, with each JSON object representing a single image group or image sequence, and containing detailed information for all exported labels.

The example below describes all the keys for a single exported data unit.

<Accordion title=" Keypoint ">

Keypoints are represented in the export using only `x` and `y` coordinates. 

```json
 "point": {
    "0": {

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title=" Rotatable Bounding Box ">

`x` and `y` represent the coordinates of the top-left corner of the _unrotated_ box. `h` and `w` respectively represent the height and width of the box, while `theta` represents the angle of clockwise rotation of the bounding box _about the centre of the box_.

<Accordion title=" Bitmask ">

The `rleString` encodes the Bitmask label, and has to be decoded. See our [SDK documentation](/sdk-documentation/sdk-labels/sdk-bitmasks#decoding-bitmask-labels) to learn how to decode an `rleString`.

```json
"objects": [
      {
        "bitmask": {

### Exporting Bitmasks

Bitmask labels are exported as `rleString`s. See our [SDK documentation](/sdk-documentation/sdk-labels/sdk-bitmasks#decoding-bitmask-labels) to learn how to decode an `rleString`.

<Tip>We strongly recommend exporting [Bitmask labels using the Encord SDK](/sdk-documentation/sdk-labels/sdk-bitmasks#downloading-bitmask-annotations-from-encord). Bitmasks are exported in the JSON format.</Tip>


<Tip>Use the [COCO API](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi) to [decode Bitmasks when using the COCO export format](/sdk-documentation/sdk-labels/sdk-bitmasks#creating-bitmask-images-from-coco-export).</Tip>

## Exporting Labels using the SDK

Go [here](/sdk-documentation/sdk-labels/sdk-working-with-labels#exporting-labels) to learn how to export labels using SDK.

## Label Branches

The branch associated with the labels is specified using the `branch_name` key.

The main branch is always displayed first and is identified by the following value:

```json
"branch_name": "main"
```
