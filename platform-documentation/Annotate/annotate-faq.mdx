  <Accordion title="How can I resolve platform access issues for users in India?">

  Some users in India may experience issues accessing the app due to restrictions imposed by certain ISPs. This is a known issue related to the infrastructure used by our platform. For credibility and real-time updates, you can check the [Firebase Status Page](https://status.firebase.google.com/) to confirm whether there are any ongoing outages or incidents.  

  If you are located in India and encounter problems accessing the app, follow these steps:  
  1. **Use the India-specific app domain**: Access the app via our India-specific domain: [https://app.in.encord.com/login](https://app.in.encord.com/login).  
  2. **Verify CORS Settings**: Ensure that the CORS settings for your cloud storage buckets have been updated correctly. Detailed instructions can be found in our cloud integration documentation: [AWS](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations/annotate-aws-integration#4-allow-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors), [GCP](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations/annotate-gcp-integration#json-configuration-file), [Azure](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations/annotate-azure-blob-integration#5-creating-a-cors-configuration-in-azure).

## Projects

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" How do I manage teams, or create user groups?">
    You can create user groups within your organization. These can be added to specific Projects as teams.

  - Our documentation on user groups can be found [here](/platform-documentation/General/general-your-organization#creating-user-groups).

  - For information on how to create teams for a given Project see the [Team Management section](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-gettingstarted/curation-management-annotation#4-team-management) in our documentation.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does the 'This is being edited' pop-up in the label editor mean">
    Don't worry, no data has been lost! This is a warning from our system (known as the "editor lock") it occurs when:

- Two different people are editing a task at the same time.
- Or, that one individual has the task open in two different tabs, or browser windows.

In both cases we recommend to click 'cancel' to prevent any unexpected data overwrites.

See [our documentation here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-label-editor#editor-lock) for more details.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title=" Why is there a warning sign next to my Project where it's listed">

A warning symbol is displayed when a project is too large - meaning it contains too much data. When selecting the project you should encounter the following message:

> ⚠️ 
> "This project has exceeded the recommended number of tasks. To avoid performance issues, you need Admin access to manage and reduce the amount of data in this project".

The diagram below illustrates the steps you should take to fix the issue.

## Datasets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" What's the difference between image groups, and image sequences?">
    Both image groups and image sequences are file types you can create in Encord to make labeling your images easier and more efficient. Both are created by taking multiple single images as an input, and compressing these into a single data unit. The difference lies in the resulting data unit. 

- Image groups can contain images of varying orientations and are best thought of as a collection of images. 
- Image sequences can only contain images of the same orientation - which allows them to be treated the same way that videos are in which each input image constitutes a single frame of the resulting image sequence. 

See our [documentation here](/platform-documentation/General/general-supported-data#image-groups) for more details.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" How do I upload DICOM data? ">
    How to upload you DICOM data depends on whether you plan on using files stored in a private cloud, or locally. 

- Local files can be dragged-and-dropped when [creating a new Dataset](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#creating-datasets).
- Files from your private cloud are uploaded using [JSON files](/platform-documentation/Index/add-files/index-register-cloud-data#json-format). We do not support upload via the CSV file format.

For information on uploading your DICOM files using the Encord SDK, see the relevant documentation [here](/sdk-documentation/getting-started-sdk/sdk-register-data-aws).


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I update client metadata?">
      Client metadata can be updated by including the `"upsert_metadata": true` flag in the upload JSON file. An example JSON file is provided [here](/platform-documentation/Index/add-files/index-register-cloud-data#update-client-metadata).
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title=" If I have duplicate Datasets, how can I find out which one is which? ">

1. Navigate to _Datasets_ on our platform from https://app.encord.com or https://app.us.encord.com.
2. Re-name both datasets to make them distinguishable.
3. Open up both cases in the editor, and see which one is which (e.g. which one is annotated and which is not).

<Note>For information on how to delete a dataset see our documentation [here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#danger-zone-deleting-datasets).</Note>


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I make sure my videos load quickly?">
    1. An annotator’s download speed from private cloud storage has to be at least 3-4 times the video bitrate.
2. Make sure the videos have enough keyframes for smooth frame-by-frame navigation (roughly every 50 frames for high-resolution videos).



  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title=" How do I re-encode videos? ">

<Note>Re-encoding is only available to Enterprise customers. Contact [sales@encord.com](mailto:sales@encord.com) for more information. </Note>

- Customers not using _Files_ can re-encode videos on our platform when uploading the data to a Dataset. 
- Customers using _Files_ can re-encode videos in the _Files_ section of the platform by right-clicking the video and selecting **Re-encode**.
- You are notified if we detect your files need re-encoding. 

See the [re-encoding data](/platform-documentation/General/general-supported-data#re-encode-your-data) section in our documentation for more information.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" What video formats are supported? ">
    We support the following formats and codecs:

- `.mp4` file with `h.265`.
- `.mp4` with`vp9`.

Please visit our [documentation on compatibility](/platform-documentation/General/general-supported-data) for more information on data compatibility.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" I am getting an error when I try to display video or DICOM files. How can I fix this? ">
    This could be browser issue. To resolve:
1. Ensure you are using the Chrome browser.
2. [Turn hardware acceleration off](https://www.howtogeek.com/412738/how-to-turn-hardware-acceleration-on-and-off-in-chrome/).
3. If you are still stuck, contact [support@encord.com](mailto:support@encord.com) for assistance.

## Annotate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" Why can't I see all classifications/annotations when reviewing? ">
    Check the [sampling rate](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manage-annotation-projects#sampling-rate). 

It's possible that you are seeing a different number of classifications/annotations than expected because you have the sampling rate set too high/low.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" What is causing the error I'm seeing in the Label Editor? ">
    There might be several possible causes if you see a "Something Went Wrong" error message in the Label Editor:

1. CORS issues - when rendering an image or video from remote storage solutions (AWS S3, GCP, Azure) it is important to set up a valid Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) Policy and failure to do so will result in errors when trying to load that remote content in the Encord application. 

To resolve these, check that a valid CORS policy is applied to the remote storage bucket, which allows Encord's domains. This varies between providers. For AWS the corresponding JSON looks like this:

<CodeGroup>

```json Global
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://app.encord.com",
            "https://api.encord.com"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```
```json US
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://app.us.encord.com",
            "https://api.us.encord.com"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Connectivity issues - Check that your local connection is fast and performant. We also recommend that, when configuring your remote storage, you choose a location geographically proximate to your annotators to ensure the smoothest loading experience.
3. Occasionally, you might notice an error loading from remote storage if the remote storage bucket itself is newly provisioned. This is because the cloud provider sometimes provisions in any region first (to improve provisioning speed) then moves it to the requested region afterwards. If the issue is not resolver after ~1hr, contact Encord support.


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is the Label Editor crashing, and what can I do about it?">
    If the Label Editor crashes after attempting to load your cloud data file, it is likely that the signed URL is expiring. Refreshing the Label Editor re-signs the URL. 

We recommend [increasing the expiration time for signed URLs on your integration](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations#edit-custom-signed-url-expiration-times).

## Ontologies

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title=" Can I re-order an Ontology? ">

<Note>Re-ordering an Ontology is only possible using the SDK. We are looking to add a more user-friendly version of this functionality into our UI in the future.</Note>


The following example is used to re-order the first two objects, and attributes in an existing Ontology using the SDK. Pass the `<ontology_hash>` into the `user_client`'s `get_ontology` method, perform the relevant changes, and call `ontology.save()` to commit the changes:

```python
# Import dependencies
from encord import EncordUserClient

# Authenticate with Encord using the path to your private key
user_client = EncordUserClient.create_with_ssh_private_key(
    ssh_private_key_path="<private_key_path>"
    )


ontology = user_client.get_ontology("<ontology_hash>")

# Re-arrange first and second objects in the Ontology.
first_object = ontology.structure.objects[0]
second_object = ontology.structure.objects[1]

ontology.structure.objects[0] = second_object
ontology.structure.objects[1] = first_object

#Re-arrange attributes in the Ontology 
first_att = ontology.structure.objects[0].attributes[0]
second_att = ontology.structure.objects[0].attributes[1]

ontology.structure.objects[0].attributes[1] = first_att  
ontology.structure.objects[0].attributes[0] = second_att

ontology.save()
```

  </Accordion>

## Cloud Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" How do I set up an integration with Azure?">
    There are two methods to set up an Azure integration. 

1. By generating an account-level shared access signature (SAS).
2. By using a service principal. Your user needs to be the admin of your Azure tenants for this method. 

Both methods are described in detail in our documentation [here](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations/annotate-azure-blob-integration)


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Can I pre-select frames to label for a video using the SDK? ">
    Yes, you can!

To do so, add an extra feature in the Ontology naming it, for example: `Selected` -> `Yes`. 

Share the ontology tree with Encord Support [support@encord.com](mailto:support@encord.com) to allow us to match the import script with the feature uuid (`featureNodeHash`).
