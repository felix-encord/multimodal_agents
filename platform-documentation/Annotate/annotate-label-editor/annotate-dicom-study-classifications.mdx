Encord automatically identifies series belonging to the same study using the Study UID found in the metadata. This allows you to work with DICOM studies.

Before working with DICOM studies in Encord, ensure you take the following steps:

1. [Create one or more Datasets](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets#creating-datasets) containing the DICOM series you want to label. We recommend creating one Dataset per study. Refer to our [best practices](/platform-documentation/General/best-practices) for efficient data uploading guidelines.

2. [Create a Manual QA Project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manual-qa-projects), and attach the Dataset(s) containing your DICOM studies to the Project. 

<Info>You must create a Manual QA Project for study-level workflows.</Info>

### Apply study level classifications

1. Navigate to the _Settings_ tab of your Project. 
2. Enable the [_Study level classifications_ toggle](#dicom-settings) in the _DICOM_ section.

4. Optionally, [click the **View full study** button](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-label-editor/annotate-dicom#view-full-study) to see all the series in your study.

5. Select a classification from your list of Ontology classes.

6. Click the **Study** button to apply the classification to all series in the study.

<Tip>Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> keyboard shortcut to apply classifications to studies.</Tip>
