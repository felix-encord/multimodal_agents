Text files include formats such as `.txt`, `.md`, `.rst`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.json`, and more. However, HTML files are categorized slightly differently from other text file types. As a result, this documentation is divided into separate **Text** and **HTML** sections.  

<Note> To learn how to import text and HTML see our documentation here.</Note>

<Info>  
The following types of labels can be applied to all text files, and at least one must be present in your project's ontology to enable text labeling:  

- **Text Region**: Object labels applied to a specific region within the text file.  
- **Classifications**: Classification labels applied to the entire file.
