An Ontology, also referred to as a taxonomy or labeling protocol, defines what is being labeled to make the data interpretable by computer vision applications. This structured framework categorizes the types of objects and concepts that are to be identified and annotated within images, videos, audio files, documents, and DICOM files.

<Tip>For more information on how Ontologies can be structured, see our [Ontology structure documentation](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-ontologies/annotate-ontologies).</Tip>
