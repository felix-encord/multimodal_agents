The user who created the Ontology is granted admin privileges, which gives full control over the Ontology including adding other team members as viewers and admins. 

Add and manage users in the _Team_ pane of the [_Settings_ tab of the Ontology](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-ontologies/annotate-working-with-ontologies#ontology-settings).

The following table summarizes user based access control for each role.
