Restricted Groups are Workforce user groups who are completely independent of each other. Org Admins can create a special type of Team Manager (Workforce Team Manager) to manage restricted groups.

Org Admins have complete over sight in to all restricted and unrestricted groups. While restricted groups and their Workforce Team Managers can see nothing of the other groups.

<Note>Contact your Encord support representative to create the Workforce Team Managers for your restricted groups.</Note>

The table below illustrates the role-based access control for various Project actions available to different user types. When using restricted groups, the restricted groups can only view and perform actions on their own Datasets, Ontologies, Workflows, and Projects.

## Working with Restricted Groups

### Workforce Team Manager Tasks

<Note>Workforce Team Managers, we recommend that your workforce personnel create alias email accounts for each workforce they are a part of. For example, an annotator Chris is part of the workforce for two different companies and creates 2 different alias accounts: chris+acme-annotator@company.com and chris+zula-annotator@company.com.</Note>

Workforce Team Managers must prepare a list of workforce personnel with the role (Annotator, Reviewer, Annotator + Reviewer) that each user has on the team.

The list is then sent to the Org Admin.
