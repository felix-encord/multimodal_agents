## Workflows

_Workflows_ are a powerful tool to design and build your Projects - letting you control how tasks move through different stages of the Project, and determining how different stages interact with one another.

On this page you can find: 

- [A step-by-step tutorial on setting up and configuring a Workflow](#creating-workflows).
- [An explanation of all Workflow composer components](#workflow-composer-components).
- [An explanation of all Workflow library components](#workflow-library-components).
- [A guide to Managing Collaborators](#managing-collaborators)
- [A guide to Workflow Templates](#templates)

***

### Creating workflows

<Note>Workflows are created when [creating new annotation Projects](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-create-projects), and when creating [Workflow templates](#templates).</Note>


***

### Workflow composer components

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-dashboard.png" width="900" />
</div>

- **A.** **Manage Collaborators** allows you to seamlessly add users to your project as collaborators, which can be added to different stages of the workflow. 

- **B.** The _Workflow library_ contains all the components that make up a project. Drag the cards from the workflow library onto the workflow canvas (C) to build the stages a workflow should pass through. Some cards can be used more than once to create complex workflows. The configuration details for each component can be found in the [Workflow library components section](#workflow-library-components) below.

- **C.** The _Workflow canvas_ is the canvas on which you design your workflow, by connecting cards from the _workflow library_. Set up the stages you'd like your workflow to pass through from left to right, and connect them to suit your needs. Click and drag the canvas to move it. 

- **D.** Zoom in and out of the _Workflow canvas_ for convenience. Large workflow designs will require you to zoom out to see the whole picture. The zoom icon focuses in on your workflow. 

- **E.** Create the Project, or return to the previous step of the project creation process. Click **Create Project** to complete the creation process.

<Warning>Currently, connections between nodes on the canvas can't be edited within a project after its creation. However, workflow templates can be edited and configured even when attached to ongoing projects. [Click here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-workflows-and-templates#editing-existing-templates).</Warning>

***

### Workflow library components

This section contains details for all _Workflow library_ components. 

<Tip>To add library components to the canvas, click the **Add stage** button and then drag-and-drop the components onto the canvas.</Tip>

***

#### Start

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-start-component.png" width="60" />
</div>

**Start** represents the beginning an annotation task through your Workflow, and can therefore only be used once in a Project. It must have a connector linking it to the next stage. It displays the [Datasets](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets) connected to the Project, and the selected [ontology](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-ontologies/annotate-ontologies).

***

#### Annotate

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-annotate-component.png" width="60" />
</div>

**Annotate** represents an annotation stage, during which a group of annotators adds labels to tasks assigned to them.

Click an **Annotate** card on the canvas to edit. Click **x** next to the name to exit edit mode.

Click the _Edit_ icon to edit the name of the annotation stage.

<Tip> 
Annotation instructions can be added in the Project's _Settings_ after the Project is created.
</Tip>


<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-annotate-card-2.png" width="200" />
</div>

The stage will contain all available annotators selected by default. Specific annotators can be selected by clicking the **Annotate** component, and choosing the **Selective** tab seen above. Type the email address of a user you'd like to add and select them from the list. Only collaborators that have been added via [Manage collaborators](#managing-collaborators) on the Project level will be available. Click **Add** to confirm the selection. 

<Note>Only collaborators with the _Annotator_ or the _Annotator & Reviewer_ roles are available for selection. All Admins and Team Managers will be part of all annotation stages and therefore can't be added, or removed.</Note>

A Webhook can optionally be added to an annotation stage to send out notifications whenever a task is submitted. Click the _Edit_ icon next to _Webhook_ and add the URL of the server you would like to receive notifications on.

***

#### Routers

A **Router** splits the path that _annotate_ and _review_ tasks take through the workflow. Two different types of router are available: 

- [Percentage router](#percentage-router).
- [Collaborator router](#collaborator-router).

<div
  style={{
    height: '0',
    paddingBottom: '56.25%',
    position: 'relative'
  }}
>
  <iframe
    allowFullScreen
    frameBorder="0"
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/fb031c32fb8d41c2ad65ab4d594b226e?sid=86b1fe1a-2bf9-47ef-98ec-8473f8f8b5ad"
    style={{
      height: '100%',
      left: '0',
      position: 'absolute',
      top: '0',
      width: '100%'
    }}
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
  />
</div>

#### Percentage router

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/percentage-router-icon.png" width="200" />
</div>

Pathways that data units take through the Workflow can be split according to a certain percentage of annotation tasks. For example, 50% of tasks get sent to _review stage A_, while the other 50% of tasks get sent to _review stage B_, splitting the workload between two different groups of reviewers.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-percentage-router.png" width="500" />
</div>

Once the router selects a route for a given task, it will be routed the same way until the routing percentages are updated. This means that if a task passes through a percentage router and is routed to _review stage A_ on its first pass, it will be routed to _review stage A_ on each consecutive pass.

<Note>Routing percentages can be changed after Project creation. Changing routing percentages resets the percentage router, and may alter the pathway taken by a given task. </Note>

#### Collaborator router

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/collaborator-router-icon.png" width="200" />
</div>

Determine the paths that data units take through your workflow based on users. For example, if _user A_ completes a task it gets sent to be reviewed by _review stage A_, while a task completed by _user B_ gets reviewed in _review stage B_. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-collaborator-router.png" width="500" />
</div>

The _Or else_ option accounts for all collaborators not explicitly added to the router. In the image above they will be directed to _review stage C_.

1. Click **Add pathway** to select a subset of collaborators that will make up a pathway - only collaborators present in the previous stage can be selected. There is no limit on the amount of pathways you can create.

2. Click **Add** to finish a pathway. 

<Note>Collaborators can only be added to the **Router** after an input is connected.</Note>

***

#### Review

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-review-component.png" width="300" />
</div>

**Review** represents a review stage where tasks labeled in an annotation stage are reviewed. 

<Note>To attach the _Rejected_ node of the review stage to another review stage, contact [support@encord.com](mailto:support@encord.com)</Note>

Click a **Review** card that has been added to the canvas to edit. Click **x** next to the name to exit edit mode.

Click the _Edit_ icon to edit the name of the review stage. This is particularly useful when your Project has multiple review stages. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflow-review-card.png" width="200" />
</div>

The stage contains all available reviewers selected by default. Specific reviewers can be selected by clicking the **Review** component, and choosing the **Selective** tab seen above. Type the email address of a user you'd like to add and select them from the list. Only collaborators that have been added to the [Workflow](#managing-collaborators) or the [Project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-project-settings#manage-project-collaborators). Click **Add** to confirm the selection.

<Note>Only collaborators with the _Reviewer_ and _Annotator & Reviewer_ roles are available for selection. All Admins and Team Managers are part of all review stages and cannot be removed.</Note>

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-review-add-users.png" width="300" />
</div>

#### Strict review

<Note>Strict review is enabled by default, but can be disabled under _Advanced settings_.</Note>

_Strict review_ ensures that crucial details are not overlooked during a review stage. Strict review aids in assuring higher accuracy when reviewing annotations. 

_Strict review_ stages do not auto-advance to the next review task after [bulk approving or rejecting](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-label-editor#approve-and-reject-all-in-frame-buttons) labels. Reviewers can make adjustments to their review, and add comments when rejecting tasks with missing annotations.

    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/strict-review-2.png" width="300" />
</div>

#### User assignment restriction

The _User assignment restriction_ feature prevents team members working on tasks in the current stage that they have done in previous stages. This can prevent individuals with the _Annotator & Reviewer_ role from being assigned their own annotations to review. 

This feature does not apply to users with the _Admin_ or _Team Manager_ roles, since they are added to each stage by default and cannot be removed.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/annotate/annotate-user-restriction.png" width="200" />
</div>

Enable the toggle to implement _User assignment restriction_.

***

#### Agent

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/agentnode-2.png" width="300" />
</div>

The **Agent** component represents a Task Agent. It triggers a custom operation each time a task passes through the Agent stage. The exact operation being triggered is configured using the Encord SDK. 


{/*
You can add a [Webhook](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications) to this stage to receive notifications whenever a task arrives at the **Agent** stage. Click the Edit icon next to _Webhook_ and add the URL of the server you want to receive notifications on.
\*/}


To fully connect an Agent to other Workflow components you must add pathways that allow you to create connections from the Agent stage to other components. To add a pathway, click **+** next to _Add pathway_ and give the pathway a meaningful name. Repeat this step for each additional pathway you want to add. 

<Tip>Learn more about Task Agents in our [Task Agent section](/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-task-agents)</Tip>

***

#### Complete

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflows-complete-component.png" width="60" />
</div>

**Complete** represents the stage of a Project at which a task is marked as complete, and can therefore only be used once per project.

Having passed though your Workflow, it was deemed to be acceptable data for the training of machine learning algorithms. Complete tasks can still be accessed by admins.

Optionally, add a [Webhook](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications) to this stage to receive notifications whenever a task arrives at the **Complete** stage.Click the Edit icon next to 'Webhook' and add the URL of the server you would like to receive notifications on.

#### Workflow stage level collaborators

Collaborators can be added to a workflow stage by clicking **+** on a card that has been added to the workflow canvas.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/add-annotator-workflows.png" width="200" />
</div>

 Learn how to add collaborators to different stages of a Project by visiting the relevant sections in this document:

- [**Annotate**](#annotate) collaborators.
- [**Review**](#review) collaborators. 
- Collaborator type [**Router**](#routers).

If no collaborators are specified at a given stage, all users with permissions are added by default. 

For example, if no collaborators are specified at an **Annotate** stage then all collaborators with the following roles will be added by default: 

- Annotator
- Annotator & Reviewer
- Team Manager
- Admin

### Creating templates

There are two ways of creating a workflow template: 
- In the _Workflows_ section. 
- While creating a new annotation project.

#### Creating templates in the _Workflows_ section

Select _Workflow templates_ from the _Annotate_ section of the sidebar in the Encord platform, and click the **+ New workflow template** button. Previously created templates are visible here, and can be [edited](#edit-templates) when selected.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/new-workflow-template-2.png" width="700" />
</div>

Create and configure your Workflow template, then click the **Create workflow template** button when you are done. To learn how to create and configure Workflows, see our documentation [here](#creating-workflows).

The **Create workflow template** button is greyed out until:
- The nodes in your template have been connected.
- The workflow contains a **_Complete_** stage. 
- The template has been given a title.

#### Creating templates during Project creation

New templates can be created during the [creation of a new annotation Project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-create-projects). 

Once a Workflow has been created, click the **Save as template** button to save the Workflow as a template. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/save-as-new-template.png" width="200" />
</div>

### Edit templates

You can edit Workflow templates after they have been created.

1. Navigate to _Workflow templates_ under _Annotation_. 
2. Click the name of the template you want to edit.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/workflows/workflow-templates-screen.png" width="700" />
</div>

Click the **Edit** button, as highlighted in the image below. 

<Note>You can not edit the start nodes.</Note>

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/edit-template-button.png" width="700" />
</div>

Once you have made all desired edits, click the **Save template changes** button. 

The **Save template changes** button will be greyed out until: 
- The nodes in your template have been connected.
- The workflow contains a **_Complete_** stage. 
- The template has been given a title.

## Template settings

The template settings allow you to: 

- [Manage the team that has access to the template](#team). 
- [Delete the template](#deleting-templates).

### Team

The _Teams_ section allows you to control which users have access to the template. There are two types of user roles for templates: 

- _Admins_ can view as well as edit the template. 
- _Viewers_ can only view the template. 

<Note>Once a new Admin has been added, they can not be removed from the template. </Note>

#### Adding users to a template

1. Click the **+ Invite collaborators** button. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/template-collaborators.png" width="600" />
</div>

2. Select a user role for the collaborator by choosing an option from the list.

3. Type the email address of the user you'd like to add and select the user from the list. 

4. Click the **Add** button to add the user with the specified role.

<div class="flex justify-center">
