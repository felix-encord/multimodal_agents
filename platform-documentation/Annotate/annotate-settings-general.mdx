Use the _Settings_ page to change your account's settings. 

To navigate to settings:

1. Click the user icon in the top-right of the Encord platform.

2. Click **Settings**.

   ![Access Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/annotate-settings.png)

The settings have several tabs:

- **General**: Your user login credentials. Change your password and set up [Multi-Factor Authentication](#multi-factor-authentication) for your Encord user account. This is where [Encord Labs](#encord-labs) appears, if available.
- **[Public keys](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-api-keys)**: creating and managing [SDK](/sdk-documentation/getting-started-sdk/installation-sdk) & [API](/sdk-documentation/getting-started-sdk/installation-sdk) keys.
- **[Notifications](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications)**: creating and managing push notifications.

## Multi-Factor Authentication

In addition to your login credentials, Encord recommends that you add the alternate SMS verification to receive SMS for OTP while logging in to the Encord platform. You can enroll single or multiple devices for authentication.

1. From the user menu, click **Settings**.
