Webhooks are automated requests that send a JSON payload with information about a Project or task to a specified URL at a designated point in your Project's Workflow. For example, if a webhook is added to the _Complete_ stage of a Project, then a JSON payload containing the Project and task ID is sent every time a task reaches the _Complete_ stage. 

<div
  style={{
    height: '0',
    paddingBottom: '56.25%',
    position: 'relative'
  }}
>
  <iframe
    allowFullScreen
    frameBorder="0"
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/a0c7b2ee886e4d7980c85c5e45789251?sid=d04507fc-b070-46cd-9d9a-5337b230c243"
    style={{
      height: '100%',
      left: '0',
      position: 'absolute',
      top: '0',
      width: '100%'
    }}

</div>


Common use-cases for webhooks include: 

- [Automatically exporting labels when they are marked as complete](/platform-documentation/Annotate/general-sync-work-to-cloud-storage). 

- Setting up a daily report to track the number of annotation tasks submitted for review each day.

## Setting up Webhooks

Webhooks can be set up when creating or editing a Workflow. This includes setting up a Workflow while creating a new annotation Project, creating a Workflow template, or editing the Workflow of an existing Project.

<Note>Webhooks can only be added to _Annotate_ and _Complete_ stages. [Webhooks on _Annotate_ stages](#task-submitted-payload) trigger when tasks are submitted for review. [Webhooks on _Complete_ stages](#task-submitted-payload) trigger when a task is completed.</Note>

1. With the Workflow open, click the Workflow stage you want to create a webhook for.
A pop-up for to configure the Workflow stage appears.

2. In the pop-up, click the _Edit_ symbol under the _Webhook_ heading.

3. Enter the URL you want the [JSON payload](#webhook-event-payloads) to be sent to. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard to confirm.

<div class="flex justify-center">

4. Ensure you save your changes.

## Webhooks for Manual QA Projects

<Info>Manual QA Projects will be deprecated soon. We strongly advise using [Workflow Projects](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manage-annotation-projects).</Info>

Use the _Notifications_ tab in [_Settings_](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-settings-general) to manage push notifications and webhooks for [Manual QA Projects](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manual-qa-projects). 

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/notifications-tab.png" width="900" />

Filter and manage notifications using the:

- **_+ Create notification_ button**: Initiates the [notification creation flow](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications#creating-notifications).
- **Search bar**: Typing in the search bar will filter the notifications by title.
- **List of notifications**: Click the _gear_ button to change a notification's settings and click the _red bin_ button to delete a notification.

You can create a number of event-based or timing-based notifications to help monitor your Project's activity:

- **Email**: send an email when certain events happen.
- **Slack**: send a Slack message when certain events happen.
- **Digest**: send regular emails giving a summary of activity over a given time period.
- **Webhook**: send a JSON payload to a REST endpoint when certain events happen.

### Creating notifications

To create a new notification, click the **+ Create notification** button in the [Notifications view](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications). This initiates the notification creation flow, a simple step-by-step process for creating push notifications.

#### 1. Enter details

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/notification-new-1.png" width="900" />

In the 'Enter details' screen, enter a notification title and optional description. A clear title and description helps keep your notifications organized and helps collaborators find what they are looking for. When you are happy, click **Next**.

#### 2. Add projects

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/notification-new-2.png" width="900" />

In the 'Add projects' screen, select the projects you would like to include in this notification. When you are happy, click **Next**.

#### 3. Add channels

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/notification-new-3.png" width="900" />

In the 'Add channels' screen, choose how you would like to receive the notification. 

#### Slack channels

Click the **Add Slack channel** button to add a Slack channel.

Once redirected to the Slack web page, make sure to first select the correct workspace from the top right drop-down list. Then select the channel you would like to post Slack notifications to.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/slack-channel-add.png" width="900" />

Add the channel and make sure to refresh the grid by clicking on the refresh icon above the Slack channels grid.  
For a given user the available Slack channels are shared between all notifications.

#### Email addresses

Enter the email addresses of everyone who should receive the notifications in the entry box. A list of emails will appear above the box for each entered email.

<Note>Encord attempts to reduce the number of outgoing emails.  </Note>
> New emails are not sent immediately, instead the email notifications are aggregated and sent in 5 minute intervals.  
> Consequently, you may not receive emails immediately on the triggering of an event.

#### Webhooks

Add a webhook by clicking the **Add webhook** button. Fill in all the relevant information.  
You can create, change, and delete webhooks. You cannot attach or detach webhooks. To "detach" a webhook you need to delete it. Webhooks CANNOT be shared between notifications.

[Click here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-webhooks-notifications#webhook-event-payloads) for a list of all possible events.

#### 4. Add triggers

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/admins/settings/notifications/notification-new-4.png" width="900" />

In the 'Add triggers' screen, choose what type of events trigger a notification. A notification can have multiple triggers. You can choose from 'Reactive events' and 'Digest events':

- **Reactive events**: notification trigger in reaction to an event
- **Digest events**: notification trigger at a scheduled times of day

Use the info icon next to the event type to get more detailed explanations on when these events are triggered. 

#### 5. Create the notification

Click **Create** to create the push notification.
