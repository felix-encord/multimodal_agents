Encord provides several distinct automated labeling techniques to help you create labels fast and with little effort:

1. [Segment anything model (SAM)](/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-sam) allows you to automatically create labels around distinct features in all supported file formats.

2. [Interpolation](/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-interpolation) is an automated process to estimate the location of labels between two manually created labels. Simply put, it is "filling in the blanks" between labels you've created. 

3. [Object tracking](/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-tracking) is a process to estimate the location of a label based on pixel information enclosed within the labels you have manually provided.

4. [Auto segmentation tracking](/platform-documentation/Annotate/automated-labeling/annotate-sam2-video-tracking) accurately tracks polygon and bitmask labels across a range of frames.

<Note>If you want to build and train models to detect specific objects, see our [documentation on models](/platform-documentation/Annotate/models)!</Note>

### What's the difference between models and automated labeling techniques?

There are key differences to understand between using models or the automated labeling techniques outlined above. 

- [Models](/platform-documentation/Annotate/models) need to be trained to 'learn' how to identify specific objects or classifications. Once a model has been trained, it is able to automatically label a dataset _without needing manual labels as an input_. One model can be used across many projects. 

- Automated labeling, as outlined above, is much simpler and uses information provided by manual labels to automatically estimate the location of missing labels.
