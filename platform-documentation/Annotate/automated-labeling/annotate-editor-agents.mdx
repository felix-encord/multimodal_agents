<Tip>Editor Agents are API endpoints triggered on individual tasks within the Label Editor. They differ from Task Agents, which are Workflow components that activate on all tasks passing through the Agent stage.</Tip>

Editor Agents enable you to integrate your own API endpoint, such as your own model hosted on a server (or in a cloud function), with Encord to enhance your annotation processes. Agents can be called while annotating in the Label Editor. 

## Permissions

Editor Agents are available to all project user roles, including Admin, Team Manager, Annotator + Reviewer, and Annotator. However, restrictions apply to certain [organization-level user roles](/platform-documentation/General/general-your-organization#user-roles).
