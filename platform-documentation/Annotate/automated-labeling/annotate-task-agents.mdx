## TLDR;

<Tip>Do you already know what you are doing and only want to look over a Jupyter Notebook example? We provide one [here](#end-to-end-agent-example).</Tip>

Task Agents are Workflow components in which a custom operation on all tasks in the Agent stage can be triggered. This allows you to set up pre-labeling, such as using foundation models such as GPT-4o, automated quality assurance, or any other custom action you need for your workflow. 

<Info>Tasks in the Agent stage are processed in the order of their [task priority](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-projects/annotate-manage-annotation-projects#task-priority).</Info>
