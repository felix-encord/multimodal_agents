Classification models predict frame-level classifications in a Project's Ontology. Rather than labeling objects within the data, classification models learn to characterize the frame as a whole. For example, a classification model trained to distinguish night from day can be used to determine whether a given image was taken during the day, or at night. 

<Note>Classification models assume there is only one correct class per image. </Note>

## Framework and models

The [FastAI framework](https://www.fast.ai/) is available for classification models, and it supports a wide range of architectures. 

These include various sizes of [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).

## Creating classification models

To learn how to create classification models, head over to our [models](/platform-documentation/Annotate/models#creating-models) page.


## Working with classification models

Once a model has been [attached to a project](/platform-documentation/Annotate/models#attaching-models-to-projects) it can be used to perform the functions it has been trained on. Inside the label editor, click the **Automated labeling** button highlighted in the image below.

To run inference with a classification model, open the 'Classification' section.

- Select the model you would like to run. You will be able to choose from a list of models previously attached to the project. 

- Specify the _Classification range_ to set the range of frames over which the model is run. 

- Set the _Confidence_. A value ranging from 0 to 1 that represents how confident the model has to be in order for a particular data point to be included in its output. Read more about [confidence values here](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-label-editor#confidence-score).

#### Advanced settings

- Choose whether the model should run on a GPU or CPU (The choice may be limited by the execution environment). CPUs are designed to handle a wide-range of tasks quickly, but are limited in how many tasks can run at the same time. GPUs are designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently.

<Note>Attributes are only predicted when the 'parent' classification has already been made. Consider the case where we have a classification structure that asks 'Is there a car in the frame?' and if the answer is yes, then we also have a nested question of 'Is the car red?'. If you run a model that trains on 'Is the car red?', it will only return inference results for frames that you have classified as having a car in the frame. This ensures conditional relationships are always enforced with automated labelling as well.</Note>
