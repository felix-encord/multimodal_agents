Service accounts in Encord are non-human accounts that allow you to use Encord in a programmatic manner. For example, you might want to set up automated workflows using Encord's SDK to do things like create Ontologies, create Projects, or even label and review tasks.

## Create Service accounts

Only Encord Admins (not Project Admins) can create Service Accounts in Encord. 

**To create a Service Account:**

1. Go to **My organization > Service Accounts**.
   The _Service Accounts_ page appears.

   ![Create Service Account](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/getting-started/encord-service-account-create-account.gif)

2. Click **Create service account**.

3. Provide a meaningful name for the service account. The name provided is appended into the email address used by the service account.

4. Provide a meaningful description for the service account.

5. Click **Create service account**.
   A new service account appears in the Service Account list.

6. Click into the service account.

7. Click **New API key**.

8. Type a meaningful title for the key.

9. Click **Add API key**.
   A file downloads to your computer containing the key.

10. Return to the **Service Accounts** page.

6. Apply a role to the service account: 
   - **Admin:** Executive privileges over the Organization such as adding and removing users, and the ability to view all Projects in the Organization.
   - **Member:** No administrative privileges over your Organization. Can only view Projects they create, or have been invited to.

<Note>Encord Admins can create 1 Service Account per organization. Contact us at support@encord.com if you need more than 1 Service Account.</Note>

## Using Service Accounts

<Note>Service Accounts are NOT accessible using the Encord UI. Service Accounts can only be used through the Encord SDK.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an SSH Key">
    [Generate an SSH key](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-api-keys#generating-keys-in-encord-recommended) for the Service Account to use the SDK.

   <Note>Each Service Account can create 5 SSH keys for use with Encord. Contact us at support@encord.com if you need more than 5 SSH keys for your Service Account.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Encord SDK">
    [Install the Encord SDK.](/sdk-documentation/getting-started-sdk/installation-sdk)

    <Note>Update the Encord SDK regularly to use all the latest programmatic features.</Note>
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup your programmatic pipelines">
    [Use Encord's SDK](/sdk-documentation/getting-started-sdk/installation-sdk) to setup your programmatic pipelines.

   <Tip> 
   A common use case is creating a Service Account with managerial privileges, enabling it to perform key administrative tasks on behalf of the Organization Admin. See how to perform organization wide actions using the SDK [here](/sdk-documentation/general-sdk/sdk-org-actions).
