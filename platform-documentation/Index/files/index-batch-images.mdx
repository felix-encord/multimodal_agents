Images in _Files_ can be combined into image groups and image sequences. 

<Tip>To learn about the difference between image groups and image sequences, see our [documentation here](/platform-documentation/General/general-supported-data#comparing-file-formats).</Tip>

1. Navigate to the folder that stores the images you want to combine. 

2. Select the images you want to include in the image group or image sequence. 

3. Right-click your selection and hover on **Batch images as**. 

4. Select **Image group** to create an image group, or **Video (image sequences)** to create image sequences. 

<Tip>Image groups can consist of images with different dimensions. In contrast, image sequences are images that all have the same dimensions. When images of varying dimensions are grouped together, multiple image sequences are created, each containing files that share the same dimensions.</Tip>
