You can create custom analytics dashboards from the _Analytics View_ using _Distribution_ and _Correlation_ charts.

## Distribution charts

Distribution charts display distributions and summaries of the selected metrics and custom metadata.

Here are some examples:

- Data unit: Frame number, random value, area 
- Metadata: Enum with their enum options, numeric, date time, and boolean

<Note>`varchar` (previously `string`), `text` (previously `long_string`), and `uuid` are NOT SUPPORTED for use in Distribution charts.</Note>

## Correlation charts

Correlation charts display a scatter plot of two attributes to show correlation within your current filtered view. Correlation charts require numeric data.

<Note>Distribution charts support a number of custom metadata types, however Correlation charts ONLY SUPPORT `numeric` custom metadata.</Note>
