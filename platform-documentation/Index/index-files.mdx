_Files_ is your one-stop shop for everything related to data in Encord - offering robust cloud storage capabilities along with intuitive options for managing, organizing, and integrating your data into [Datasets](/platform-documentation/Annotate/annotate-datasets/annotate-datasets).

</div>

<Note>Data is structured into folders and subfolders. All files must be placed into folders and cannot be added to the top level / root directory. </Note>

## What can I see in _Files_? 

Organization admins can see all the files and folders created by users in your Organization. 

Non-admin users can view all folders they create and files they upload. Additionally, they can see any folders they have been added to as a viewer or admin. For more details, refer to [Manage folder collaborators](#manage-folder-collaborators).

Rows
Columns
StudyInstanceUID
SeriesInstanceUID
SOPInstanceUID
PatientID
The following DICOM tags are required to render DICOM images in 3D:

ImagePositionPatient
ImageOrientationPatient
SliceThickness
PixelSpacing
</Note>

- **E** - _Import from private cloud_ : Add any data stored in your cloud storage. At least one [data integration](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations) is required to register cloud data. Learn how to upload private cloud data [here](/platform-documentation/Index/add-files/index-register-cloud-data). Click **Import** to finish.


### Create image groups and image sequences

Image groups and image sequences are created when you upload files into Encord in _Files_.

1. Open the _Add data_ dialog. 
2. Select the _Batch images as_ tab.
3. Select _Image group_ to create an image group. Select _Image sequence_ to create an image sequence.

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/batch-images.png" width="450"/>
</div>

4. Drag-and-drop the local images you want to batch into an image group or image sequence. Learn how create image groups and image sequences from cloud data [here](#adding-private-cloud-data). 

5. Click **Upload and batch images** to create the image group or image sequence.

6. A file representing the image group or image sequence is created in the folder. A new folder appears containing all the constituent images of the image group or image sequence that was created. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/docs-media.encord.com/static/img/image-grouop-folder.png" width="300"/>
</div>

<Note>
- The new folder containing the constituent images is not synced.
- Adding new images to this folder does not add them to the image group or image sequence.
- Files contained in the image group or image sequence cannot be deleted from the folder until the image group or image sequence is deleted.
</Note>

### Register Cloud Data

<Tip>We recommend uploading files in batches not exceeding 2GB, to ensure upload does not exceed 3 hours.</Tip>

To add data from your private cloud you need the following:

- A [private cloud integration](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations). 

- A [JSON or CSV file specifying the data](/platform-documentation/Index/add-files/index-register-cloud-data#specify-cloud-data) you want to add from your private cloud.

See our documentation on [data integrations](/platform-documentation/General/annotate-data-integrations), and [adding cloud data](/platform-documentation/Index/add-files/index-register-cloud-data) for comprehensive guides.

## Add data to Datasets

After data is uploaded to _Files_ it can be added to one or multiple Datasets.

1. Locate and select the data you want to add to a Dataset. 

<Tip>To add multiple files to a Dataset, bulk-select files by selecting the first file, and then selecting the last file while holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key on your keyboard.</Tip>

2. Right-click your selection and select **Add to dataset**. 
A dialog appears. 

<div class="flex justify-center">
