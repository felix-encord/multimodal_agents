Filtering, sorting, and searching data in Encord Index is crucial for various reasons. It enables insights and actionable results on the following key aspects and more:

- Identification of patterns, trends, or anomalies within a subset of the data.

- Recognition of duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.

- Removal of irrelevant, noisy, and erroneous data.

- After filtering, sorting, and searching your data, use Collections with Annotate Projects to streamline your annotation process.

Encord Index provides the following methods:

- **Filter:** Refine your searches using quality metrics, custom metadata, Collections, folder, data title, and data types.

- **Sort**: Sort your data, in ascending or descending order, using quality metrics.

- **(Coming soon) Natural language search**: Enter descriptive queries in everyday language to make it easier to find relevant images without the need for specific keywords or complex search parameters.

- **Embedding plot**: A two-dimensional visualization technique used by Encord to represent high-dimensional data in a more interpretable form. Use the plot to select points within a specific rectangular area, thereby focusing on a particular subset of data points for in-depth analysis.


# Filters

In the Index Explorer for a Project you can refine searches by data quality metrics, Collections, custom metadata, folders, data titles, and data types.

<Tip>
Filters provide the ability to include or exclude images based on your filtering criteria.
</Tip>

<b>Video Quality Metrics:</b> Video quality metrics are calculated as your videos import into Index. Examples include, Area, Clip duration, Frames per second, Number of frames.

<b>Data Quality Metrics:</b> Data quality metrics are calculated as your videos import into Index. Examples include, Area, Frame number, Random value.

## Preset Filters

Preset filters provide a way to save your filtering criteria for use and reuse in Index. All preset filters are available everywhere in Index. This means that some preset filters might not return any results. For example, a preset filter might use a specific Folder (Folder A) in the filtering criteria, but if you open Index in a different Folder (Folder B) and the first Folder (Folder A) is not a child of the other Folder (Folder B) no results are returned.

### Create a Preset Filter

Create Presets (Preset Filters and their settings) from the _Filter_ tab.

**To create a Preset (Preset Filter and their settings):**

1. Log in to the Encord platform.
   The landing page for the Encord platform appears.

2. Go to **Index > Files**.
