Index is a data management system, that allows AI teams to visualise, sort, and control their data. The purpose is to give teams a better ability to control their curation process, enabling models to be put into production faster with better model quality. 

## When to use Encord Index?

Encord Index helps you visually understand and improve your data at all stages of your machine learning journey. Index does not just store your data, you can curate your data too.

<Note>Before going any further, you should know what a Collection is in Encord Index. Collections provide a way to save interesting groups of data units to support and guide your downstream workflow.
