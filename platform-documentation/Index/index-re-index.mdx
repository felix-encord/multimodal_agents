<Info>Re-indexing the data in your Folders for Index is not something that should be done lightly. This feature is meant to help resolve issues.</Info>

## What does the re-index feature do?

Re-index allows you to force a re-indexing of all images, videos, and audio files in Index. 

## What does that mean exactly?

Index allows you to visualize the contents of your Folders and sub-Folders. As data comes into your Folders, that data is indexed for Index so the data can be almost immediately visible. Re-indexing wipes the slate clean (the index of your data in the Folders) and re-indexes the contents of your Folders for Index.

## Why would I re-index Index data?

If you encounter an issue displaying, sorting, or filtering one or more images/videos/frames/audio files in Index.


<Info>We STRONGLY recommend that you do not re-index as you are importing data to the Folder that you are looking at in Index.</Info>

## How long does re-indexing take?

How long re-indexing takes depends on how much data and how many Folders are being re-indexed. Re-indexing Folders with a huge amount of data can take hours.

## How do I re-index Index data?

<Info>Please provide a reason why you are re-indexing. The more information you provide, the more prepared we can be with a follow-up.</Info>

Click the **Re-index** button in Index.
