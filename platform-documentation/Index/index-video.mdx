Use the _Video_ tab to natively view all the videos available in your Folder. From the _Video_ tab you can sort and filter all of your videos based on [Video Quality Metrics](/platform-documentation/Active/active-quality-metrics/active-video-quality-metrics#video-quality-metrics). You can also apply video frame level metrics while in the _Video_ tab.

<Info>Video frames are sampled for metric and embedding calculation at 1 FPS starting from the first frame. Using [`keyframes` and custom metadata](/platform-documentation/Index/custom-metadata/index-custom-metadata) you can specify the frames you want imported. Contact us to discuss changing the sampling frame rate how to indicate specific frames.</Info>
