Encord supports Single Sign On (SSO) for [Enterprise customers](https://encord.com/pricing/). [Contact our sales team](https://encord.com/contact-us/) to upgrade to the Enterprise price plan and set up SSO. 

## What is SSO?

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication mechanism that enables users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of login credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and enter separate usernames and passwords for each system, enhancing user experience and security.

[Contact our sales team](https://encord.com/contact-us/) to upgrade to the Enterprise price plan and set up SSO.
